# Leaf-Disease-Detection

Leaf disease classification project. Implemented image noise removal with Gaussian blur to reduce high-frequency noise and median filtering to replace each pixelâ€™s value with the median value in its local neighborhood. Explored various classification concepts like the Kernel trick, AdaBoost, conditional independence assumption, out-of-bag error, bootstrapping, and Laplace Smoothing
