# Leaf-Disease-Detection

Leaf disease classification project aims at classifying leaf diseases via image processing. It has implemented image noise removal techniques like Gaussian blur to reduce high-frequency noise and median filtering to replace each pixelâ€™s value with the median value in its local neighborhood. It explores various classification concepts like the Kernel trick, AdaBoost, conditional independence assumption, out-of-bag error, bootstrapping, and Laplace Smoothing.
